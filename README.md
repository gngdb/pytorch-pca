If I try and write PCA from memory in PyTorch I always make a mistake so it
doesn't do exactly the same thing as scikit-learn's PCA with the same settings.
This is a minimal implementation of PCA that matches scikit-learn's with default
settings (run `pca.py` to test this).

Now includes:

* `pca.py`: matches sklearn's [PCA][]
* `incremental_pca.py`: matches sklearn's [IncrementalPCA][], _contributed by: [`yry`][yry]_

# Install

Open `pca.py`, copy the code you'd like to use and then paste it where you'd
like to use it.
